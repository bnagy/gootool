Silly PoC of a limited otool clone based on the capstone disassembly lib

Eventually aiming to produce silly graph output with D3.js

This is a toy, not a tool.

TODO:
=======

Next step is to code the CFG architecture and write a transformer for each BBL to a Node struct with edges and whatever other metadata. After that, add the D3 html template code, CSS, etc, then write a transformer for the CFG nodes to the required raw data as JSON.

As if.
